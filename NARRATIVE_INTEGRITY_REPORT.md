# NARRATIVE INTEGRITY REPORT (The World Model)

## 1. Narrative Coherence Metrics
- **Role Definition Rate**: 99.7% of actors have a clear legal role.
- **Causal Density**: 82.4% of States are triggered by a specific Event. (Higher is better).
- **Temporal Anchoring**: 99.5% of Events are firmly grounded in the timeline.

## 2. Memory Gaps (Forward Falling Questions)
- ✅ **Strong Causality**: Most state changes are explained by the timeline.

## 3. Recommendations
- If **Causal Density** is low, adjust the Operator Prompt to "Look for the Event that caused this State".
- If **Anchoring** is low, enable "Date Inference" logic in the Reconciler.
